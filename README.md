# CALCULATOR WITH JAVASCRIPT PROJECT

- **Publisher–Subscriber Pattern** – Decoupling components through event-based communication
- **Array Methods** – Practical use of `map()`, `sort()`, and `filter()`
- **Parcel Bundler** – Using Parcel for efficient bundling and project setup
- **NPM Packages** – Managing dependencies in a professional workflow
